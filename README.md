# Chatbox-using-Python-Socket-Programming

## Statement of Objectives

The objective of this project is to create an **instant messaging system** using Python, supporting a **single server** and **multiple client connections**. This project aims to provide real-time messaging between clients connected to a central server. To enhance usability, the system includes a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, making it more user-friendly and visually accessible.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple yet functional chat application where multiple clients can communicate through a single server. The server manages client connections and relays messages to other clients in the chat, supporting a seamless communication experience.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Client Support**: Multiple clients can connect to the server simultaneously.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Messages are delivered instantly to all connected clients.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The GUI provides an intuitive and accessible interface for users, enhancing the chat experience.

## Components

- **Server**: The server application handles client connections, message relays, and client disconnections. It acts as a central hub for all communications.
- **Client**: The client application connects to the server and sends/receives messages in real-time.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Built using Python libraries, the GUI allows users to send and receive messages in an organized and user-friendly chat window.

## Language and Libraries

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Socket**: For network communication between server and clients.
  - **Tkinter**: For creating the GUI components of the chat application.
